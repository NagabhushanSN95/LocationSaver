Using Location Saver, you can save the location (coordinates) of any place you visit or locations shared through messengers like WhatsApp. Once the locations are saved, you can open them in Maps anytime by clicking on the location and choosing your favorite Maps app (need not be Google Maps always).
If you changing your phone or resetting the phone, you can export the data to SD card and import later. Using the same feature, you can share locations to your friends as well. 
Worried about your privacy. No need. All locations data will be saved in your phone only and no data is shared with anyone.
